## 🎯 What We'll Build Today

Over the last 12 sessions, we've built a feature-complete website — navbar, hero carousel, about section, faculty cards, timetable, gallery, contact form, login system, countdown timer, dark mode, back-to-top button, FAQ accordion, and a clean footer. Everything works. But right now, it looks… well, it looks like **every other Bootstrap website** on the internet.

Today we fix that. Think of it this way: **you've built the house, now it's time to paint, decorate, and furnish it.** We'll give our class website a unique personality — custom colors, beautiful fonts, smooth animations, hover effects, and a polished look that screams *"BCA Batch 2025-26 made this!"*

**By the end of this session, you'll have:**

- ✅ An external stylesheet `css/custom.css` linked correctly (overriding Bootstrap)
- ✅ A custom color scheme using CSS variables (change one value, entire site updates!)
- ✅ Google Fonts for beautiful headings and body text
- ✅ Hover effects on cards, buttons, nav links, and gallery images
- ✅ Smooth transitions and scroll behavior
- ✅ Enhanced dark mode with proper variable overrides
- ✅ Responsive adjustments for smaller screens
- ✅ A website that looks uniquely *yours* — not generic Bootstrap

**Before → After:**

## 📌 New CSS Concepts Table

No new HTML tags today! Instead, here are the **CSS concepts** you'll learn:

| Concept | What It Does | Analogy |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `<link rel="stylesheet">` | Connects an external CSS file to the HTML page | 📌 Like attaching a *dress code sheet* to a party invitation |
| CSS Specificity | Rules for which style wins when there are conflicts | 🤼 A wrestling match — the more specific selector wins |
| `:root` selector | Targets the very top-level element (the whole document) | 🏠 The main switch board of the house — controls everything |
| `--custom-property` | CSS variable — a reusable named value | 🎨 A paint palette board — change one swatch, all paintings update |
| `var(--name)` | Uses a CSS variable's value | "Use whatever color is on the palette board" |
| `transition` | Smoothly animates changes between two states | 🚪 A door that swings open slowly instead of teleporting open |
| `transform: translateY()` | Moves an element up/down without affecting layout | 🎈 Lifting a card off the table — the table doesn't move |
| `transform: scale()` | Makes an element bigger/smaller | 🔍 A magnifying glass effect |
| `::after` pseudo-element | Creates a virtual element after an element's content | Adding an invisible underline decoration that appears on hover |
| `@media` (responsive) | Applies CSS only when screen matches certain conditions | "If classroom has < 30 students, use smaller desks" |
| `@media print` | Applies CSS only when the page is being printed | "When xeroxing notes, skip the colorful background" |
| `filter: brightness()` | Adjusts how bright/dark an element appears | Like turning the brightness knob on a TV |
| `scroll-behavior: smooth` | Makes page scroll smoothly instead of jumping | 🛗 Elevator vs. teleportation — both reach the same floor |
| `box-shadow` | Adds shadow around an element | 📦 The shadow under a book lying on a desk |
| `line-height` | Controls vertical spacing between lines of text | 📏 The gap between lines in a ruled notebook — wider lines = easier to read |
| `position: relative/absolute` | Controls how an element is positioned on the page | 📍 `relative` = "shift from my normal spot"; `absolute` = "pin me exactly inside my parent" |
| `content` (CSS property) | Sets generated content for `::after`/`::before` pseudo-elements | 🏷️ Adding a virtual label or decoration that only CSS controls |
| `overflow: hidden` | Clips anything that extends beyond an element's boundary | ✂️ A photo frame — anything outside the frame is cut off |
| `display: flex` | Turns an element into a flexbox container for alignment | 📐 A magnetic board — children snap into rows/columns automatically |
| `align-items` / `justify-content` | Align flex children vertically / horizontally inside a flex container | ↕️↔️ Centering items on the magnetic board — vertical and horizontal controls |
| `letter-spacing` | Adjusts the gap between individual characters | 🔤 Spreading letters on a banner to fill the width evenly |
| `text-decoration` | Adds or removes underline, overline, or strikethrough on text | ✏️ Underlining a word in your notebook — or erasing the underline |
| `opacity` | Controls how transparent an element is (0 = invisible, 1 = solid) | 🪟 Frosted glass vs. clear glass — lower opacity = more see-through |
| `break-inside: avoid` | Prevents a page break from splitting an element (print only) | 📄 "Don't tear this card in half when printing across two pages" |
| `@keyframes` | Defines step-by-step frames of a custom CSS animation | 🎬 A flipbook — each keyframe is one drawing in the animation sequence |
| `animation` | Applies a `@keyframes` animation with speed, delay, and repeat | ▶️ Pressing play on the flipbook — controls how fast and how many times it runs |
| `background-attachment: fixed` | Keeps background image fixed while content scrolls over it | 🖼️ A painting on the wall — you walk past it, but it stays still (parallax) |
| `rgba()` | Color value with transparency — `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)` | 🎨 Mixing paint with water — alpha controls how see-through the color is |
| `:focus` pseudo-class | Activates when user clicks into or tabs to an element | 🔦 A spotlight on the form field you're currently typing in |
| `:not()` pseudo-class | Excludes elements matching a condition | 🚫 "Everyone EXCEPT those with the `.collapsed` class" |

## 📖 External CSS — The Right Way to Style

### Three Ways to Add CSS (Lab 10 vs. Lab 11)

You've already seen CSS in three forms:

| Method | Syntax | When to Use | Analogy |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Inline CSS** (Lab 10) | `<p style="color: red;">` | Quick testing only | Scribbling notes on your hand — works, but messy |
| **Internal CSS** | `<style>` in `<head>` | Single-page sites | Writing notes in your notebook — organized, but only in one book |
| **External CSS** (Lab 11) | `<link href="style.css">` | Real projects ✅ | A printed dress code — one sheet, every student follows it |

📌 **From now on, we ONLY use external CSS.** Inline and internal styles don't scale. Imagine 50 pages all needing the same button color — would you write `style="color: red;"` 200 times? No! One external file, one change, every page updates.

### Creating the File

In your project folder, create this structure:

```
📂 BCA-Website/
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📂 js/
│   └── 📄 script.js         ← Created in Session 12
├── 📂 css/
│   └── 📄 custom.css        ← Creating TODAY!
└── 📂 images/
    └── (your images)
```

### Linking It — Order Matters!

📌 **Critical Rule:** Your custom CSS file **MUST** be linked **AFTER** the Bootstrap CSS link.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>BCA Batch 2025-26</title>

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS (FIRST — the base coat of paint) -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
          rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Google Fonts (SECOND — load the fonts) -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600&family=Poppins:wght@600;700&display=swap"
          rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Our Custom CSS (LAST — our paint goes ON TOP of Bootstrap) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/custom.css">
</head>
```

**Why after?** Think of it like painting a wall:
1. 🏗️ **Bootstrap** paints the wall white (default styles)
2. 🎨 **Your custom.css** paints over it with your chosen colors

If you reverse the order, Bootstrap's white paint covers your colors. **Last loaded = last applied = wins!**

## 📖 CSS Specificity — How to Override Bootstrap

### The Wrestling Match Analogy

When two CSS rules conflict, the browser needs to decide which one wins. This is called **specificity** — and it works like a wrestling tournament. The heavier (more specific) selector wins.

📌 **Specificity Weight System:**

| Selector Type | Weight | Example | Analogy |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------|
| `!important` | ♾️ (infinity) | `color: red !important;` | The principal's order — overrides everyone |
| Inline style | 1000 | `style="color: red;"` | The HOD's decision |
| `#id` selector | 100 | `#hero { color: red; }` | A professor's instruction |
| `.class` selector | 10 | `.btn { color: red; }` | A class representative's suggestion |
| `element` selector | 1 | `p { color: red; }` | A student's opinion |

### How Specificity Math Works

```
p                    →  0, 0, 0, 1  (just an element)
.btn                 →  0, 0, 1, 0  (one class)
.btn-primary         →  0, 0, 1, 0  (one class)
#hero .btn           →  0, 1, 1, 0  (one id + one class = 110 > 10)
section .btn-primary →  0, 0, 1, 1  (one class + one element = 11 > 10)
```

### Overriding Bootstrap — Three Strategies

**Strategy 1: Same Specificity, Loaded Later (Best ✅)**

Bootstrap says: `.btn-primary { background-color: #0d6efd; }`
Your CSS says:  `.btn-primary { background-color: #2c3e50; }`

Both have specificity 10. But your file loads AFTER Bootstrap — **last one wins!**

**Strategy 2: Increase Specificity (When needed)**

If Strategy 1 doesn't work for some Bootstrap rule, add more context:

```css
/* Bootstrap's rule */
.navbar-brand { font-size: 1.25rem; }

/* Your override — more specific because you added "nav" context */
nav .navbar-brand { font-size: 1.5rem; }
```

**Strategy 3: `!important` (Last resort ⚠️)**

```css
.some-stubborn-class {
    color: #2c3e50 !important;
}
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Using `!important` is like the principal yelling over everyone. It works, but if you overuse it, nobody can override anything anymore. It becomes chaos. Use it only when Strategy 1 and 2 fail.

## 📖 CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

### The Color Palette Board

📌 **CSS Variables** (officially called *Custom Properties*) let you define a value once and reuse it everywhere. Think of them as a **color palette board** hanging in an art classroom:

- The board has labels: "Primary Color = Deep Blue", "Accent Color = Red"
- Every student painting a project looks at the board and uses those colors
- The teacher changes "Primary Color" on the board to Green → **every painting updates automatically**

### Defining Variables

Variables are defined in `:root` — the very top level of the document (same as `<html>`):

```css
:root {
    /* === Color Scheme === */
    --primary-color: #2c3e50;       /* Deep blue — our brand */
    --secondary-color: #e74c3c;     /* Vibrant red — for accents */
    --accent-color: #3498db;        /* Bright blue — links, highlights */
    --bg-light: #f8f9fa;            /* Light background */
    --bg-dark: #1a1a2e;             /* Dark mode background */
    --text-dark: #2c3e50;           /* Main text color */
    --text-light: #ecf0f1;          /* Text on dark backgrounds */

    /* === Typography === */
    --font-heading: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    --font-body: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;

    /* === Effects === */
    --transition-speed: 0.3s;
    --shadow-sm: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    --shadow-md: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    --shadow-lg: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    --border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Using Variables

```css
body {
    font-family: var(--font-body);
    color: var(--text-dark);
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: var(--font-heading);
    color: var(--primary-color);
}

.btn-primary {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    border-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

📌 **Why is this powerful?** Want to change your entire website from a blue theme to a green theme? Change **one line** — `--primary-color: #27ae60;` — and every heading, button, border, and highlight that uses `var(--primary-color)` updates instantly. No "Find and Replace" across 500 lines of CSS!

---

## 📖 Google Fonts — Beautiful Typography

### Why Default Fonts Look Boring

Every computer has its own fonts. A website using `font-family: sans-serif;` will look different on a Windows PC, a MacBook, and an Android phone. **Google Fonts** gives you free, consistent fonts that look the same everywhere.

### Choosing a Font Pair

A good website uses **two fonts** — one for headings (bold, attention-grabbing) and one for body text (clean, easy to read):

| Role | Our Choice | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Headings | **Poppins** (600, 700 weight) | Modern, geometric, great for titles |
| Body text | **Open Sans** (400, 600 weight) | Clean, highly readable, works at any size |

> 💡 **Tip:** Visit [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) and search for "Poppins". You can preview it with your own text — type "BCA Batch 2025-26" to see how it looks!

### Adding Google Fonts

The `<link>` tag goes in `<head>`, BEFORE your custom CSS but AFTER Bootstrap:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600&family=Poppins:wght@600;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet">
```

Breaking it down:
- `family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600` → Load Open Sans in regular (400) and semi-bold (600)
- `family=Poppins:wght@600;700` → Load Poppins in semi-bold (600) and bold (700)
- `display=swap` → Show fallback font first, swap to Google Font when it loads (no blank text!)

### Applying Fonts in CSS

```css
body {
    font-family: var(--font-body);  /* 'Open Sans', sans-serif */
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: var(--font-heading);  /* 'Poppins', sans-serif */
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `line-height`?** This property controls the vertical spacing between lines of text. A value of `1.7` means 1.7× the font size — if text is 16px, lines are spaced about 27px apart. The default is around `1.2`, which feels cramped for body text. Setting `line-height: 1.6`–`1.8` makes paragraphs much more comfortable to read — you'll see it applied to `body` in our complete stylesheet below.

---

## 📖 Hover Effects & Transitions

### Why Hover Effects Matter

When a visitor hovers over a button and **nothing happens**, the website feels dead. But when a card lifts slightly, a button glows, or a nav link gets an animated underline — the website feels **alive and professional**.

Think of it like walking into a shop — a good shop has music playing, lights adjusting as you walk, products that draw your eye. Hover effects are the web equivalent.

### The `transition` Property

📌 The `transition` property tells the browser: *"When a property changes, don't change it instantly — animate it smoothly over time."*

```css
/* Syntax */
transition: property duration timing-function;

/* Examples */
transition: transform 0.3s ease;            /* Only animate transform */
transition: all 0.3s ease;                   /* Animate ALL properties */
transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;  /* Multiple */
```

| Part | What It Means | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `property` | Which CSS property to animate | `transform`, `opacity`, `all` |
| `duration` | How long the animation takes | `0.3s` (300 milliseconds) |
| `timing-function` | Speed curve of the animation | `ease` (slow start/end, fast middle) |

### Card Hover Effect — "Lift Off"

When you hover over a faculty card, it should gently lift up and gain a deeper shadow:

```css
.card {
    transition: transform var(--transition-speed) ease,
                box-shadow var(--transition-speed) ease;
    border: none;
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm);
}

.card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);    /* Move 5 pixels UP */
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);   /* Deeper shadow = "lifted" look */
}
```

📌 `translateY(-5px)` — Negative value moves UP. Think of a Y-axis graph: negative = up, positive = down. The card literally "lifts off the page" by 5 pixels.

### Button Hover Effect — "Pulse & Glow"

```css
.btn-primary {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    border-color: var(--primary-color);
    transition: all var(--transition-speed) ease;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);                              /* 5% bigger */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.4);     /* Blue glow */
    background-color: var(--accent-color);
}
```

### Nav Link Hover Effect — "Animated Underline"

This is the most impressive effect — an underline that grows from the center when you hover:

```css
.nav-link {
    position: relative;          /* Needed for ::after positioning */
    color: var(--text-dark);
    transition: color var(--transition-speed) ease;
}

/* 📌 ::after creates an invisible element right after the link text */
.nav-link::after {
    content: '';                 /* Empty content — we just want the line */
    position: absolute;
    width: 0;                   /* Starts invisible (zero width) */
    height: 2px;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 50%;                  /* Starts from center */
    background-color: var(--accent-color);
    transition: all var(--transition-speed) ease;
}

/* On hover, the line expands to full width from center */
.nav-link:hover::after {
    width: 100%;
    left: 0;                    /* Now starts from the left edge */
}

.nav-link:hover {
    color: var(--accent-color);
}
```

📌 **`::after` Pseudo-Element:** This creates a "virtual" element that doesn't exist in the HTML. It's like having an invisible underline decoration that only appears when the mouse is nearby. The `content: ''` is required — without it, the pseudo-element won't render.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `position: relative` and `position: absolute`?** By default, every element flows naturally in the page (`position: static`). Setting `position: relative` on `.nav-link` creates a positioning context — it becomes the "reference frame." Setting `position: absolute` on `::after` removes it from normal flow and lets `bottom: 0; left: 50%;` pin it to the bottom center of the link. Think of `relative` as the picture frame and `absolute` as a sticker you place exactly where you want inside that frame.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `content: ''` (CSS property)?** The `content` property is required for `::after` and `::before` pseudo-elements to render. Even an empty string (`''`) works — we just need the pseudo-element to exist so we can style it as an underline. Without `content`, the pseudo-element is invisible and takes up zero space.

---

## 📖 Smooth Scrolling

When someone clicks a navbar link (e.g., "Gallery"), the page currently **jumps** to that section. Let's make it **glide** smoothly:

```css
html {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
    scroll-padding-top: 70px;   /* Offset for fixed navbar height */
}
```

That's it — two lines! Now every anchor link (`<a href="#gallery">`) scrolls smoothly.

📌 **`scroll-padding-top: 70px;`** — Without this, the section heading would hide behind the fixed navbar. This adds 70px of padding so the section starts just below the navbar. Adjust this value to match your navbar's height.

---

## 📖 Section Styling & Dividers

### Clean Section Separation

Right now our sections flow into each other without clear boundaries. Let's add subtle dividers:

```css
section {
    padding: 60px 0;
    position: relative;
}

/* Add a subtle line between consecutive sections */
section + section {
    border-top: 1px solid #eee;
}

/* Alternating background for visual rhythm */
section:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: var(--bg-light);
}
```

📌 **`section + section`** — This is the **adjacent sibling selector**. It means "a `<section>` that comes *immediately after* another `<section>`." The first section gets no top border; every subsequent one does.

---

## 📖 Gallery Image Hover Effect

Make gallery images feel interactive — zoom slightly and brighten on hover:

```css
.gallery-img {
    border-radius: var(--border-radius);
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, filter 0.3s ease;
    cursor: pointer;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.gallery-img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    filter: brightness(1.1);       /* 10% brighter */
}
```

📌 **`filter: brightness(1.1)`** — CSS filters let you apply Photoshop-like effects to elements. `1.0` is normal, `1.1` is 10% brighter, `0.8` would be 20% darker. Other filters include `blur()`, `grayscale()`, and `contrast()`.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `overflow: hidden`?** When an image scales up on hover (`scale(1.05)`), it grows slightly beyond its container's boundary. `overflow: hidden` clips the excess — the image zooms but stays neatly within its rounded corners. Think of it like a photo frame: anything outside the frame edge is cut off.

---

## 📖 Enhanced Dark Mode Styles

In Session 11, we added dark mode with JavaScript toggling a `dark-mode` class. Let's enhance it with **proper CSS variable overrides**:

```css
body.dark-mode {
    /* Override the light-mode variables */
    --primary-color: #3498db;
    --secondary-color: #e74c3c;
    --accent-color: #5dade2;
    --bg-light: #16213e;
    --text-dark: #ecf0f1;
    --shadow-sm: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
    --shadow-md: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);

    background-color: var(--bg-dark);
    color: var(--text-light);
}
```

📌 **The magic of CSS variables + dark mode:** When `body.dark-mode` is active, `--primary-color` changes from `#2c3e50` to `#3498db`. Every single element using `var(--primary-color)` — headings, buttons, borders — automatically updates. No JavaScript required for the color change!

```css
/* Dark mode specific element overrides */
body.dark-mode .card {
    background-color: #1a1a2e;
    border: 1px solid #2a2a4a;
}

body.dark-mode .navbar {
    background-color: #0f3460 !important;
}

body.dark-mode section + section {
    border-top-color: #2a2a4a;
}

body.dark-mode .form-control {
    background-color: #16213e;
    border-color: #2a2a4a;
    color: var(--text-light);
}

body.dark-mode .table {
    color: var(--text-light);
}

body.dark-mode footer {
    background-color: #0a0a1a !important;
}
```

---

## 📖 Responsive Adjustments

Bootstrap handles most responsiveness, but our custom styles need fine-tuning on smaller screens:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .display-4 {
        font-size: 1.8rem;         /* Smaller hero heading on mobile */
    }

    .lead {
        font-size: 1rem;            /* Smaller subtitle text */
    }

    section {
        padding: 40px 0;            /* Less vertical padding on mobile */
    }

    .card:hover {
        transform: none;            /* Disable lift on mobile (no hover) */
    }
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
    h2 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
    }

    .btn {
        font-size: 0.9rem;
        padding: 0.4rem 0.8rem;
    }
}
```

📌 **Why disable card hover on mobile?** Mobile devices don't have a mouse cursor — there's no "hover" on a touchscreen. The `:hover` pseudo-class behaves oddly on mobile (sometimes sticking after a tap). It's cleaner to disable hover transforms on small screens.

## 📖 Print-Friendly Styles (Bonus)

When a student tries to print the timetable or contact info, we don't want the navbar, dark backgrounds, or animations:

```css
@media print {
    /* Hide navigation and interactive elements */
    .navbar, .back-to-top, .carousel, footer {
        display: none !important;
    }

    /* Remove shadows and backgrounds */
    .card {
        box-shadow: none !important;
        border: 1px solid #ccc !important;
    }

    /* Ensure readable text */
    body {
        color: #000 !important;
        background: #fff !important;
    }

    /* Show link URLs in print */
    a[href]::after {
        content: " (" attr(href) ")";
        font-size: 0.8em;
        color: #666;
    }
}
```

📌 **`@media print`** — These styles ONLY apply when someone hits Ctrl+P (print). On screen, they're completely ignored. The `a[href]::after` trick is clever — it prints the actual URL next to every link, since you can't click a piece of paper!

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `break-inside: avoid`?** When printing, the browser may split a card across two pages — top half on page 1, bottom on page 2. `break-inside: avoid` tells the printer "keep this entire card together on one page." It only matters inside `@media print` styles.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `a[href]` (attribute selector)?** Square brackets in CSS select elements based on their HTML attributes. `a[href]` matches only `<a>` tags that have an `href` attribute. Combined with `::after`, it generates the URL text next to printed links. This is a CSS-only trick — no JavaScript needed!

## 🔨 Let's Build! — Step by Step

### Step 1: Create the File

1. In your project folder, create a new folder called `css` (if it doesn't already exist)
2. Inside `css`, create a new file called `custom.css`
3. Your project structure should now be:

```
📂 BCA-Website/
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📂 js/
│   └── 📄 script.js
├── 📂 css/
│   └── 📄 custom.css    ← NEW!
└── 📂 images/
```

### Step 2: Add Links in `<head>` of `index.html`

Add these two lines AFTER the Bootstrap CSS link:

```html
<!-- Google Fonts -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600&family=Poppins:wght@600;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Custom CSS (MUST be last!) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/custom.css">
```

### Step 3: Write the Complete `custom.css`

Copy the following complete stylesheet into `css/custom.css`:

```css

> 🎨 **That's 300+ lines of production-quality CSS!** Every section of our website is now custom-styled, with hover effects, transitions, dark mode support, responsive design, and even print-friendly styles.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `display: flex`, `align-items`, `justify-content`?** In the back-to-top button styles (section 13 of the stylesheet), `display: flex` turns the button into a flex container. `align-items: center` vertically centers the arrow icon, and `justify-content: center` horizontally centers it. Together they create a perfectly centered icon inside a circle. Flexbox is Bootstrap's secret weapon — classes like `d-flex` and `align-items-center` are just shortcuts for these CSS properties!

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `letter-spacing`?** In the countdown timer styles (section 14), `letter-spacing: 1px` adds 1 pixel of extra space between each character. This gives text a slightly spread-out, elegant look — commonly used for headings, countdown timers, and decorative labels.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `text-decoration`?** In the footer link hover styles (section 12), `text-decoration: underline` adds an underline on hover. By default, browsers underline all `<a>` links. Bootstrap removes this with `text-decoration: none`. Here we bring it back on hover for visual feedback.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `:focus`?** The `:focus` pseudo-class activates when a user clicks into or tabs to a form field. In the form styles (section 10), `.form-control:focus` adds a blue border and soft glow, giving users clear visual feedback about which input they're currently typing in. Always style `:focus` for accessibility — keyboard users rely on it!

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `:not()`?** The `:not()` pseudo-class excludes elements matching a selector. In the accordion styles (section 11), `.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)` targets accordion buttons that are currently expanded — i.e., they do NOT have the `collapsed` class. It's the CSS equivalent of "everything except…"

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `rgba()`?** Used throughout for shadows and semi-transparent backgrounds, `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)` creates a color with transparency. The first three values (0–255) set the color; the fourth value (0–1) controls opacity. Example: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` = black at 50% transparency. This is how the carousel caption gets a see-through dark overlay.

> 📌 **First Time Seeing `opacity`?** Used in Challenge 3's animation, `opacity` controls how transparent an entire element is. `1` = fully visible, `0` = completely invisible, `0.8` = slightly faded. Unlike `rgba()` which sets transparency for a single color value, `opacity` makes the entire element and all its children transparent.

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

1. **Save** both `index.html` and `css/custom.css`
2. **Open** `index.html` in Chrome
3. Check each of these:
   - [ ] Fonts changed? (Headings should look different — Poppins is geometric and modern)
   - [ ] Hover over a card — does it lift up with a shadow?
   - [ ] Hover over a nav link — does the underline animate from center?
   - [ ] Hover over a button — does it scale up slightly?
   - [ ] Click a navbar link — does it scroll smoothly?
   - [ ] Toggle dark mode — do colors change smoothly?
   - [ ] Resize window to mobile — do hover effects disable?
4. **Open DevTools** (F12) → go to the **Elements** tab → click on any element → check that your CSS is applying (look for `custom.css` in the Styles panel)

### Step 5: Verify CSS is Overriding Bootstrap

In DevTools, you should see your custom rules with Bootstrap rules **crossed out** beneath them:

```
.btn-primary {
    background-color: #2c3e50;     ← from custom.css (ACTIVE)
    border-color: #2c3e50;         ← from custom.css (ACTIVE)
}

.btn-primary {
    background-color: #0d6efd;     ← from bootstrap.min.css (CROSSED OUT)
    border-color: #0d6efd;         ← from bootstrap.min.css (CROSSED OUT)
}
```

If your styles are crossed out instead, check:
- Is `custom.css` linked AFTER Bootstrap in `<head>`?
- Is the file path correct? (check for typos in `href="css/custom.css"`)

---

## ✅ Checkpoint

Open `index.html` in the browser and verify everything:

| # | Check | Expected Result | ✅ / ❌ |
|---|-------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Fonts changed | Headings use Poppins, body uses Open Sans | |
| 2 | Card hover | Cards lift up 5px with deeper shadow on hover | |
| 3 | Button hover | Buttons scale up and glow on hover | |
| 4 | Nav link hover | Animated underline grows from center on hover | |
| 5 | Smooth scrolling | Clicking nav links scrolls smoothly (not jumping) | |
| 6 | Section dividers | Subtle line between sections, alternating backgrounds | |
| 7 | Gallery hover | Images zoom slightly and brighten on hover | |
| 8 | Dark mode | All sections styled correctly (cards, forms, tables) | |
| 9 | Mobile view (resize) | Card hover disabled, text sizes adjusted | |
| 10 | DevTools check | `custom.css` rules override Bootstrap rules | |

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No style changes visible | Check `<link>` path: `css/custom.css` — case-sensitive! |
| Bootstrap styles not overridden | Make sure `custom.css` link is AFTER Bootstrap link |
| Fonts not loading | Check Google Fonts `<link>` — must be before `custom.css` |
| Hover effects jerky | Check `transition` is on the base state, not the `:hover` state |
| Dark mode colors wrong | Verify `body.dark-mode` selector matches your JS toggle class |
| Print styles not working | Use Ctrl+P to preview — they only apply when printing |

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **External CSS is the professional approach** — one file controls the entire website's look. Never use inline styles in production.

2. **Link order matters** — your `custom.css` MUST load AFTER Bootstrap CSS. Last loaded = highest priority when specificity is equal.

3. **CSS specificity is a point system** — `#id` (100) beats `.class` (10) beats `element` (1). Equal specificity? Last rule wins.

4. **CSS variables (`--custom-property`)** are game-changers — define colors once in `:root`, use them everywhere with `var()`, and change the entire theme by editing one line.

5. **Transitions go on the BASE state, not the hover state** — put `transition: all 0.3s ease;` on `.card`, not on `.card:hover`. The transition property tells the browser *how* to animate, the hover state tells it *what* to animate to.

6. **`::after` pseudo-elements** create virtual elements for decorative effects without adding extra HTML — perfect for animated underlines and dividers.

7. **Dark mode + CSS variables = automatic theming** — redefine variables inside `body.dark-mode` and every element using those variables updates instantly.

8. **Disable hover effects on mobile** — touchscreens don't have a cursor. Use `@media (max-width: 768px)` to remove `transform` on hover.

9. **Google Fonts pair wisely** — one decorative font for headings, one readable font for body text. Never use more than 2-3 fonts.

10. **`@media print` is underrated** — students printing timetables or notes will thank you. Hide navbars, remove shadows, and show link URLs.

## 🏋️ Practice Challenges

Try these on your own to cement today's CSS skills:

### Challenge 1: Create a Second Theme (⭐ Easy)

Change the CSS variables to create a completely different color scheme. Try an "MU Blue & Gold" theme:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #1a237e;       /* Dark indigo */
    --secondary-color: #ffc107;     /* Gold */
    --accent-color: #42a5f5;        /* Light blue */
}
```

**Hints:**
- Only change the `:root` variable values — nothing else!
- Verify that buttons, headings, nav underlines ALL changed automatically
- This proves the power of CSS variables

### Challenge 2: Add a Parallax Effect on the Hero Section (⭐⭐ Medium)

Make the hero/carousel background appear to move slower than the foreground when scrolling:

```css
.hero-section {
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}
```

**Hints:**
- `background-attachment: fixed;` creates the parallax illusion
- Apply this to the hero section or a section with a background image
- Test by scrolling — the background should appear "deeper" than the content
- Note: This doesn't work on most mobile browsers (iOS ignores `fixed`)

### Challenge 3: CSS Animation on the Countdown Timer (⭐⭐⭐ Hard)

Add a pulsing animation to the countdown timer to draw attention:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0% { transform: scale(1); }
    50% { transform: scale(1.05); opacity: 0.8; }
    100% { transform: scale(1); }
}

.countdown-timer {
    animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**Hints:**
- `@keyframes` defines the animation steps (0% → 50% → 100%)
- `animation: name duration timing iterations;`
- `infinite` makes it loop forever
- Try adding `animation-play-state: paused;` on hover to let users "stop" the pulse

> 💡 **New concepts in Challenge 3:** `@keyframes` defines custom animations frame by frame. Unlike `transition` (which only animates between two states), `@keyframes` can have multiple steps and loop infinitely. We'll explore animations more in Session 14!
